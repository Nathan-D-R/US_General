# R-US_General

This is a simple project I did to practice Multiple Logistic Regression, Correlation, and their respective visualizations. The dataset is very small, being just 50 states with one year of data.

We can run the script using: `rscript MLR.r`

The output will be MLR.pdf

We can run the RMD file using: `Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('US_General.rmd')"`

The output will be US_General.html
